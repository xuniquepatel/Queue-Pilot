# Distributed-Task-Scheduling-System
A scalable, fault-tolerant, and concurrent task execution system built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **Redis**. This system dynamically distributes tasks across multiple worker nodes, ensures reprocessing on worker failure, and features a dashboard for real-time monitoring.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Distributed Workers** – Run multiple workers in parallel to handle tasks.
- ⟲ **Fault Tolerance** – Heartbeat-based health checks and auto-requeue of tasks if a worker fails.
- ⚖️ **Load Balancing** – Tasks are assigned to the least loaded active worker using Redis queues.
- 🔍 **Real-Time Dashboard** – Web interface to submit and monitor tasks across queues and workers.
- 📦 **Queue Architecture** – Uses a dual-queue setup: a `task_queue` for pending tasks and `processing:*` queues per worker.
- 🧠 **Monitor Node** – Requeues stuck tasks from failed workers.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Submit a task** using the dashboard or API.
2. **Master Node** checks worker heartbeats and assigns tasks to the least-loaded.
3. Task is **pushed to the worker's `processing:<id>` queue**.
4. **Worker** picks task, processes it, removes from queue.
5. If worker fails, **Monitor** detects via stale heartbeat and requeues the task to `task_queue`.
6. **Dashboard** updates every 3 seconds from `/queue_status` API.

## 💡 Key Components

- **Master Node (Scheduler):** Handles assignment of tasks to workers using live Redis stats.
- **Worker Nodes:** Fetch and execute tasks, and send periodic heartbeats.
- **Redis Queues:** `task_queue` for incoming tasks and `processing:<worker_id>` queues for in-process tasks.
- **Monitor Node:** Detects heartbeat expiry and safely requeues unprocessed tasks.
- **Dashboard:** User interface for submitting and monitoring tasks in real time.

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/distributed-task-scheduling-system.git
cd distributed-task-scheduling-system/backend
```

### 2. Setup Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Redis
Make sure Redis is installed and running on localhost:6379.
```bash
brew install redis
redis-server
```

### 4. Start Each Component
Run these in separate terminals:

#### Master Scheduler
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
python -m master_node.scheduler
```

#### Monitor Node
```bash
python -m monitor.monitor
```

#### Worker Nodes
```bash
WORKER_INDEX=1 python -m worker_node.worker
WORKER_INDEX=2 python -m worker_node.worker
```

#### Flask API
```bash
python -m client_interface.api
```

#### Frontend Dashboard
```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 9090
```
